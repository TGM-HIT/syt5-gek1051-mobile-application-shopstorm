# Create an Offline First Shopping List with React and PouchDB

This code pattern is a reference implementation of an Offline First shopping list app, built as a [Progressive Web App](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) using [React](https://react.dev/) and [PouchDB](https://pouchdb.com/). [This app is part of a series of Offline First demo apps, each built using a different stack.](https://github.com/ibm-watson-data-lab/shopping-list)

## Featured technologies

* [PouchDB](https://pouchdb.com/) - an in-browser database that can replicate to and from a remote Apache CouchDB or IBM Cloudant database.
* [React](https://react.dev/) - a JavaScript framework for creating a user interface.
* [Apache CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/) - modern, document database hosted on your server or in the cloud.
